# My_Mobile_Developer_Journey
This is my mobile developer journey from the start!

All source code in this repository is written for personal learning purposes.
Some exercises are adapted from a programming book I study (Logika Pemrograman Java (Update Version) by Abdul Kadir),
but all code has been rewritten and translated by me for practice.

No commercial use intended.
